**Goal:** Create a high-resolution, full-color digital illustration of a doctor for a custom desk standee. The image must be a **highly recognizable illustrated portrait** of the individual from the **[Attached Source Photo]**, with the body and attire rendered **in the artistic style of** the **[Attached Style Reference]**.

**1. Subject & Core Details:**
* **Role:** Professional **Doctor/Physician** (gender from Source Photo).
* **Expression:** Pleasant, approachable, confident smile. Eyes looking directly at the viewer.
* **Attire:** Crisp white **Lab Coat** over **dark blue scrubs/v-neck top**.
* **Accessories:** Silver and black **Stethoscope** draped around the neck.
* **Pose:** Three-quarter profile, **arms crossed** over the chest.

**2. Visual Style & Likeness (CRITICAL):**
* **Art Style:** **Semi-Realistic Illustrated Portrait** (for standee). Body and clothing should reflect the **clean lines, defined shapes, and smooth, professional shading** of the **[Attached Style Reference]**.
* **Facial Likeness (ABSOLUTE PRIORITY):** The face **MUST accurately replicate the facial structure, unique realistic features, expressions, and natural proportions from the [Attached Source Photo].** It **MUST NOT resemble the [Attached Style Reference]** or any generic face. Stylize the face **minimally**, just enough to blend with the illustrated body. **Preserve the photographic identity and distinct likeness from the Source Photo with extreme fidelity.**
* **Hair:** Accurately and realistically represent hair color, style, volume, and texture from the **[Attached Source Photo]**, translated into the semi-realistic illustration style.
* **Seamless Blend:** Head and neck must be rendered in the exact artistic style (line-work, color, texture, shading) as the illustrated body for a smooth transition.
* **Proportion:** Head size realistic and proportional to the body.

**3. Background & Outlines (Layered & Precise):**
* **Layer 1 (Subject):** Illustrated doctor's shape.
* **Layer 2 (White Outline):** Immediately around the subject, a **100px wide, pure white (#FFFFFF) outline/bleed**, tightly following the subject's silhouette.
* **Layer 3 (Red Border - Top/Sides Only):** Immediately outside the white outline, a **5px solid red (#FF0000) border** on the **top, left, and right sides only**. This red border should also tightly follow the contour of the white outline. **Do NOT apply the red border to the bottom edge of the white outline.**
* **Layer 4 (Background Fill):** The area *outside* the white outline and red border (where present), extending to the canvas edges, should be **Color Hex code #8DC5FE** or transparent.

**4. Technical Specifications & Composition (CRITICAL):**
* **Output Format:** Digital Illustration, **High-Resolution (Print-Ready)**.
* **Pixel Dimensions:** **2000 x 2867 pixels (600 DPI equivalent).**
* **Aspect Ratio & Composition:** **Vertical Portrait (0.67:1).**
    * **Frame Fill (CRITICAL):** The illustrated subject, including its white outline and red border, **MUST be scaled and positioned to fill the entire vertical canvas (2000 x 2867 pixels) significantly**, similar to the **[Attached Style Reference]**, leaving **minimal empty space** around the subject. The subject should occupy the **vast majority of the frame.**
    * **STRICT CONSTRAINT:** Final image must be **exactly 2000 x 2867 pixels.**
**No extra words or content other than the subject, its white outline, its red border, and the specified background color (#8DC5FE).**

**Focus Keywords:** **EXACT 2000x2867 PIXEL DIMENSION**, **PHOTOGRAPHIC LIKENESS (ABSOLUTE)**, **REALISTIC FACE**, **MINIMAL FACIAL STYLIZATION**, **FULL FRAME OCCUPATION**, **NO BOTTOM RED BORDER**, **Layered Outlines**.
